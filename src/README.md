### Weather Web Scrapper

This is a web scrapper program that uses a variety of python libraries to scrap
and store weather data from the National Weather Service. The Program scraps
the weekly weather information from Meadvile and New York City. The user most
specify witch place they want to know the weather from. The data is then stored in
a csv file and then the program displays the data stored in the csv file using
a GUI python library. The goal of this program was to become more familiar with
python and see how simpler it was to web scrap data using python libraries than other
programming languages. The next step is to web expand and web scrap bigger data from the stock market and create a bot.
